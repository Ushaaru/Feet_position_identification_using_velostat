 This project presents a cost-effective pressure sensing mat for foot posture identification.
 In this project a mat based on velostat is used which is a carbon-impregnated polythene
 material. The sensing unit is realized as a mat of a specific size. Orthogonal copper
 tapes are stuck up and down as a matrix and a velostat in between, creating 14x13
 individual sensors. The copper tapes are connected with wires to a microcontroller
 through multiplexers. This sensing unit is used to capture the feet pressure. The
 mat pressure sensors have been interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller in order
 to monitor and control the variation of resistance as a measure of applied pressure.
 This pressure distribution across feet is projected on to the system screen. Based on
 the feet position, subject will be classified as- normal stance, tip toed, heel standing,
 over-pronation, under-pronation.
