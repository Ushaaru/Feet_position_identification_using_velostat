This project presents a cost-effective pressure-sensing mat for foot posture identification. By using a Velostat array of pressure sensors, the mat captures foot pressure based on foot position. Subjects are classified as having a normal stance, being on tiptoes, heel standing, over-pronation, or under-pronation.
This is implemented based on the reference provided in (https://www.instructables.com/O-mat/).
